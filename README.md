## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

This project taught me several valuable lessons including:

1. **Flexbox and Grid Layouts**: I deepened my understanding of using flexbox and grid systems to make responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.
   
   ```css
   .article-container {
     display: flex;
   }

1. **Positions**: I deepened my understanding of using various postions that is related to the parent container to make responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.
   
   ```css
   .article-container {
     position:relative;
   }
